# HelloCodex

This repository is a minimal demonstration of Codex's ability to update projects. It includes a Python script that greets users.

Documentation for the project is generated with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and published via GitHub Pages.

## Usage

Run `hello.py` with an optional name argument:

```bash
python hello.py            # -> Hello, Codex!
python hello.py Alice      # -> Hello, Alice!
```

### Text RPG

Run `text_rpg.py` for a tiny example of a text-based RPG battle:

```bash
python text_rpg.py
```
